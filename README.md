# Metacrafter_Avalance_Advanced_Subsets
Create a DeFi Kingdom clone üè∞ using GamingVault on Avalanche. Players battle, explore, earn tokens ü™ô, and rank on leaderboards. Deploy custom smart contracts with low fees, player achievements, and wallet integration.

# Description
ERC20 GameToken and Gaming_Vault are two smart contracts included in the project that are intended to allow for a decentralized gaming environment on the Avalanche blockchain. Using digital assets, players can travel, shop, and fight while winning rewards in unique tokens. Based on their badges, players are given option boards, which they can share with friends in the game.

# ERC20.sol
The ERC20.sol¬†contract is a token contract that functions similarly to an ERC20 token and has basic features like minting or burning tokens, granting allowances, and transferring tokens. Important characteristics consist of:
Management of Tokens
The contract controls the overall amount of tokens available, keeps track of each account's balance, and oversees the allocation of funds for delegated transfers. Transfers: Through allowances, users can designate other persons to transfer tokens on their behalf or send tokens to other addresses. Burning and Minting The generation of new tokens, their addition to the caller's account, and their removal from the caller's balance are all made possible by the contract.

# Gaming_Vault.sol
The GamingVault smart contract enables players to deposit and withdraw tokens, engage in battles, explore for rewards, and purchase items. Players' achievements, token balances, and scores are tracked, with a dynamic leaderboard to rank participants. The contract also tracks voting rights, which are granted based on player performance. Players can transfer tokens to others and register new accounts with a unique name and level. Battles are simulated based on token balances, with winners gaining additional tokens and scores. Exploration rewards players with tokens to incentivize engagement. A dynamic leaderboard ranks players by token balance and battles won, ensuring competition among participants. 
Leaderboard:
Ranks players based on token balance and battles won.
Automatically updated after key actions like deposits, withdrawals, battles, and explorations.
Integration:
Uses an ERC20 token for all token-related transactions.
Players can register with unique names and initial tokens to join the game.
